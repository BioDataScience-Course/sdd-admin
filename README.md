# Plateforme pédagogique BioDataScience

Documentation (in French) of the pegagogical platform déployed on https://wp.sciviews.org for the courses in Biological Data Science at the University of Mons in Belgium. This book will progressively change towards a more general documentation of the tools that make the platform: how to install, manage and run it. For now, it still contains material specific to our courses and it is not completely written in a way that someone else could take this book and follow instructions to build its own platform around the R package {learnitdown}, but it is the goal in the future... For now, readers could still find useful information. Interested readers could join us at sdd@sciviews.org.
